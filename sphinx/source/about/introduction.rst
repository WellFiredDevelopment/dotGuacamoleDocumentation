Introduction
============

This page aims at giving a broad presentation of the tool and of the contents of this documentation, so that you know
where to start if you are a beginner or where to look if you need info on a specific feature.

About the documentation
-----------------------

This documentation is continuously written, corrected, edited and revamped by members of the .Guacamole team and
community. It is edited via text files in the `reStructuredText <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`_ markup
language and then compiled into a static website/offline document using the open source
`Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ and `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ tools.

.. note:: You can contribute to .Guacamole's documentation by opening issues through
            `YouTrack <https://wellfired.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issues/DG>`_
            or sending patches via pull requests on its GitHub
            `source repository <https://github.com/WellFiredDevelopment/dotGuacamoleDocumentation.git>`_.

Organisation of the documentation
---------------------------------

This documentation is organised in five sections, the way it is split up should be relatively intuitive:

- The :ref:`sec-general` section contains this introduction as well as general information on the tool It also contains
  the :ref:`doc_faq`.
- The :ref:`sec-learn` section is the the first entry point of this documentation, as it contains all the necessary
  information on using the tool. It starts with the :ref:`Step by step<toc-learn-step_by_step>` tutorial which should be
  the entry point for all new users.
- The :ref:`sec-fundamentals` section is required reading for anyone intending to use .Guacamole, as it contains all the
  necessary information on using the library. Read this section for an overview of the main concepts used in .Guacamole.
- The :ref:`sec-views` and :ref:`sec-layouts` sections go over every view and layout included with .Guacamole.
- The :ref:`sec-automation` section is optional reading, but goes over the automation of your application. This is
  incredibly useful for anyone that wants to test their end product in a real world environment.
- Finally, the :ref:`sec-class-ref` is the documentation of the .Profile API. It is generated automatically from a
  files in the main repository, and the generated files of the documentation are therefore not meant to be modified.
