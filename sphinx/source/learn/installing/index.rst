Installing
==========

We've tried to package .Guacamole up in easy to use familiar ways, for devs from all backgrounds, you can find it here
packages as a Unity Package, a nuget package and you can also compile yourself from source.

.. warning:: You can currently only compile from source, a nuget package and a unity package will be provided along
            future releases, once we release our first non-alpha build.

Unity package
-------------

*Coming soon*

Download the latest .unitypackage from `.unitypackage <https://github.com/ArtOfSettling/.Guacamole/releases/latest>`_
and extract it into your Unity Project. For importing instructions, refer to
`Unity's documenatation <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetPackages.html>`_

Through nuget
-------------

*Coming soon*

Install WellFired.Guacamole directly using either nuget on the command line, or nuget through your
`Favourite IDE <https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/>`_

Compiling from source
---------------------

1. To compile the project from source, simply open /solution/WellFired.Guacamole.sln and build with your
`Favourite IDE <https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/>`_.

2. This will build .Guacamole into the /unity directory.

3. You can now open Unity and open the project in the /unity directory
